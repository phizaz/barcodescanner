# Barcode Scanner

> Scaning barcodes to clipboard in Android

## Rationale

There are many barcode reader apps out there in the PlayStore, but none provides an easy way to scan "multiple" barcodes. This app will just let you keep scanning barcodes as long as your heart's content while keeping all the scan history right into your phone's clipboard ready to be pasted anywhere.

## Limitation

I customized it to use only "COBRA" type of barcodes.

Since it's inception it is aimed to be used with Chulalongkorn University's student card barcodes to extract student's ids within. Thus, you will see some specific cases in the codebase.

## To start

Only within the directory "zxing-sample" that I care for this moment. So, if you are interested in what I'm doing see no other place go straight to that directory. 

The rest of the artifacts will eventually be removed.
